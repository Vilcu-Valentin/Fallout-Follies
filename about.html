    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Fallout Follies, your one-stop-shop for all things nuclear! We're a team of wacky scientists and bomb enthusiasts who love to blow things up, and we want to share our passion with you!</p>
    <p>Our mission is simple: to provide you with the biggest, baddest, and most ridiculous nukes on the market. Whether you're looking to cause a little mayhem or just want to impress your neighbors, we've got you covered.</p>
    <p>We pride ourselves on our top-notch customer service. Our team of bomb experts is available 24/7 to answer any questions you may have about our products, from "How do I arm this thing?" to "Will it make my ex regret breaking up with me?" (The answer is yes, by the way).</p>
    <p>We also believe in giving back to the community. That's why we donate a portion of our profits to support research on the effects of nuclear radiation. We may be crazy, but we're not heartless!</p>
    <p>So what are you waiting for? Come check out our selection of radioactive goodies and let us help you make your next explosion one to remember!</p>
